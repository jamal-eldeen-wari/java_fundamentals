# java_fundamentals

## Lab 01: 
it took me around three hours to complete it well the delay was because of My IDE it had some issues but solved with the help of a TA. I used 3 methods:
1. pluralize method
2. flipNHeads method
3. clock method

And i ran these two commands javac Main.java and java Main.java and the program works perfectly

## Lab 02:
It took me 5 hours to complete not for the complexity of the code but the problem was the IDE that caused a lot of delay to finish the lab. In this lab i added 4 methods:
1. roll
2. containsDuplicates
3. calculateAvg
4. arrayOfArrays

And i was able to run a test and everything is working fine with my code
