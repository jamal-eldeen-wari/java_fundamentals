# java_fundamentals

## Lab 01: 
it took me around three hours to complete it well the delay was because of My IDE it had some issues but solved with the help of a TA. I used 3 methods:
1. pluralize method
2. flipNHeads method
3. clock method

And i ran these two commands javac Main.java and java Main.java and the program works perfectly
